# Advent Of Code attempts

Here is where i publish all my attempts on advent of code, and my little mix of problems I enconter.

## Structure

The root folders with numbers are advent of code, while in "[mics](https://github.com/ConAltDelete/AdventOfCodeConAltDelete/edit/main/mics/)" is a happy mix of other problems.

## Language?
Yes.
I use a broad set of languages, some by proffesion, some as a refresher, the rest are new and exciting.
